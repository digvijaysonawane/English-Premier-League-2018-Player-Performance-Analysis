English Premier League Players Analysis, 2017-2018
What is the dataset about…
The data is about market values, page views, age, position, nationality, club, and Fantasy Premier
League stats of 461 players of the 2017/18 English Premier League. The FPL stats is the FPL
points, the value, etc of every player who played for the 2017/18 league.
Story the poster will say…
For most football fans, May - July represents a lull period due to the lack of club football. What
makes up for it, is the intense transfer speculation that surrounds all major player transfers today.
Their market valuations also lead to a few raised eyebrows. I am curious to see how good proxy
popularity could be for ability, and the predictive power it would have in a poster estimating a
player's market value and compared it with the current market value they possess. Thereby a
poster describing an ideal team of 11 players who performed best at their respective position
with an optimal market value they should hold, the major transfers the top clubs need to perform
to achieve the optimal team and various background checks about the players and the clubs.
Who would care about the poster…
The English Premier League clubs, the agents, soccer fans and all the people who play Fantasy
Premier League are the targeted audiences. This audience will be able to understand the market
price a player deserves for the future transfers and also to determine which club is heading
towards being an ideal English club for the future seasons.
